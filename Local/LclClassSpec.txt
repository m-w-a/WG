A hook for the generated constructor maybe specified via a method with the 
following signature: "void init()".

//Semantics:

Note: All terms not defined here should be referenced in AutoFunctorSpec.txt

memext:
  1) Member variables initialized with external values via ctor parameters.
  2) Said member variables will be declared in the 
    order that they appeared in the user specified macro
  3) Will generate parameters for the public constructor necessary to initialize  
    said member variables.
  4) Said parameters will be declared in the same order as their corresponding
    member variables.
  5) If the type of a variable is omitted, it will be deduced from the type of 
    the variable with the same name in the enclosing scope(s) using 
    BOOST_TYPEOF.

memint:
  1) Member variables initialized with internal values.
    Such expressions may reference previously declared member variables.
  2) Said member variables will be declared in the order that they appeared in  
    the user specified macro.
  3) If implicitly typed, the types of the member variables are deduced from
    the types of the user specified expressions via BOOST_TYPEOF.
