//Semantics:

assignto:
  1) if obj type is qualified const then a compiler error will result.
    Rationale:
    It's impossible to assign to an object of a const qualified type.

return:
  1) If present then indicates the return type of the functor,
  2) else if not present and assignto is present then the return type of the
    functor is determined by the type of assignto declaration,
  3) else if not present and assignto is not present then the return type of the
    functor is void.

local()
  Rationale:
  bound vars need to be forwarded to their destination via a temporary cntnr,
  for purposes of efficiency this is done using the add_reference metafunction. 
  Since in C++03 local types have no linkage, they cannot be used as template 
  parameters, and therefore cannot be used with metafunctions. 
  Hence, the need to bind such types differently.
  
  The local keyword is to be used to wrap non-const non-reference local types.  
  Any use contrary to such will result in a compiler error. Such wrapped types
  may then be qualified via the keywords const, ref, or const ref as demonstrated
  in the BNF section.
  
  IMPL detail: in C++11 treat such types as regular types for the purposes of codegen?

this_:
  1) If encountered as a bound variable name, then it will bind to the "this" 
    keyword.
  2) If encountered as a bound variable and implicitly typed and explicitly
    qualified with the keyword const, then the constness will apply to the
    pointed-to-type.
    Rationale:
      The type of "this", and hence the type of "this_", is already const. 
      Therefore the const keyword would be redundant if applied to the "outer 
      type". The above semantics are provided as an alternative shortcut 
      to explicitly typing "this_" and const qualifying the pointed-to-type.

bound-variables:
  1) variables designated as such are bound to variables of the same name from 
    the enclosing scope.
  2) If implicitly typed, the types of such variables are determined by the
    type of the variables they are bound to via BOOST_TYPEOF. Hence, this will
    always be remove_reference<remove_const<type-of-boundee>::type>::type.
    (*) Therefore, if you want something bound by reference always use the ref
    keyword and if you want something bound by const always use the const 
    keyword.
  3) If explicitly typed, the types of such variables must be "implicitly
    convertible to" from the type of the variable that they respectively bind in
    their outer scope.

set-variables:
  1) If implicitly typed, the types of such variables are determined by the
    type of the expression they are set to via BOOST_TYPEOF. If such an 
    expression is a variable, then the caveats of b-v 2) apply.
