adhoc-scope-handlers:
  1) At least one handler must be specified.

scope-manager-expr:
  Is limited to an lvalue expression because if rvalues are allowed, then the 
  question of captured by const vs non-const arises which complicates the macro 
  syntax. So for the sake of simplicity, only lvalue expressions are handled.

on_enter:
  Upon entering the lclcontext's scope, the on_enter method of each declared 
  scope manager object is called in the order in which they appeared in the 
  opening macro, starting from first to last. Any return value is ignored unless 
  otherwise specified in the lclcontext's opening macro.
  
on_exit:
  Upen exit of the lclcontext's scope for any reason (thrown exception, return 
  statement, goto?, fall-through) the on_exit method of each declared scope 
  manager object is called in the reverse order in which they appeared in the 
  opening macro. If the lclcontext's scope was exited due to an exception being 
  thrown from that scope then "true" is passed as a parameter to on_exit, else 
  "false" is passed as a parameter.

on_exit can only be triggered by the destructor in order for it to be invoked
*any time* the scope is exited. The destructor doesn't have access to any
expressions of the enclosing scope so foreach's "downcast" trick using the
conditional operator can't be used. Hence the destructor's class must know the
types of each scope manager in order to call on_exit. This means that either
explicit scope managers or adhoc scope managers have to be type erased since in
C++03 local classes can't be templated nor be used as template parameters.
It has been decided to type erase adhoc scope managers since they are generated
by the library. This means that in C++03 the on_exit call to them will have to
go through a function pointer, but in C++11 this indirection is not necessary.
Note: it is necessary to allow the calls to the on_exit method of explicit and
  adhoc scope managers to be intermixed since the user may intermix them in the
  opening macro.
